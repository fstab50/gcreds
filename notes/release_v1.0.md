# v1.0 Release Notes
* * * 

## Features Implemented in v1.0

* [Security]: temp files used during process are now hidden files (.*)
* [Security]: temp files are written to a location in memory instead of  
disk to prevent user capture during generation of temp credentials. This  
is useful when gcreds is called by an application invoked by a user without  
permissions to view or modify the local awscli config (.aws/*)

* * *

## Limitations

* gcreds cannot have more than 1 set of temporary credentials in awscli config at  
a time. This is to prevent corruption of the local awscli config

* Temp credentials generated by gcreds have a default lifetime of 15 minutes (900 seconds).  
This is changeable in the current release via the TIMEOUT variable setting contained  
in the gcreds main executable.
