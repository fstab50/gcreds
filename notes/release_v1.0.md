# v1.0 Release Notes
* * * 

## Features Implemented in v1.0

* [Security]: Temp files used during processing are now hidden files (.*)

* [Security]: Temp files are now written to a location in memory instead of disk to prevent  
user capture during generation of temp credentials. This is useful when gcreds is  
called by an application invoked by a user without permissions to view or modify the local  
awscli config (.aws/*)

* **gcreds** now checks for the existence of active (or expired) temp credentials in the local  
awscli config before generating new temporary credentials to prevent duplicate entries  
in the local config files.  If you attempt to generate new credentials with temp credentials already  
in your config, **gcreds** will prompt you to clear your config before generating new creds.

* * *

## Limitations

* **gcreds** cannot have more than 1 set of temporary credentials in awscli config at  
a time. This is to prevent corruption of the local awscli config

* Temp credentials generated by **gcreds** have a default lifetime of 15 minutes (900 seconds).  
This is changeable in the current release via the TIMEOUT variable setting contained  
in the gcreds main executable.
