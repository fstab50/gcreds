Description: Compile and Build Any Python3 Version on Linux
  .
  buildpy is a Utility for building python3 from source binaries on Linux.
  .
  Compile and install Python 3.0 to 3.7+ major versions. Python 2.x can be
  compiled and installed; however, this has not been tested extensively.
  When a Python major version number is specified (Python 3.6 for example),
  buildpy automatically finds and installs the latest minor version available
  for download from https://www.python.org/ftp/python. buildpy has a "quiet
  mode" for scripted configuration management installs.
  .
  The buildpy utility builds Python binaries for the entire system.
  If you wish to build Python for a single user, consider pipenv
